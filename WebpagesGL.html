		<p>Hello! My name is Nick and I am a junior at NCSU.  I am in the Mechanical engineering program and lookforward to graduating in May of 2020.  
		With the time that isn't completely consumed by school I serve at my church, play video games, spend time with my parents and brothers.
		I also enjoy that outdoors and use to do a good deal of rock climbing and hiking.
