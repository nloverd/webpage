		<p>Hello! My name is Nick and I just transfered to NCSU as a <em>junior</em> from Wake Tech Community College.  I am in the <ins>Mechanical</ins> engineering program and think I might focus on robotics.
		I am lookforward to <strong>graduating</strong> in May of 2020 with a Bachelor's degree.  For the time being 
		With the time that isn't completely consumed by school I serve at my church, play video games, spend time with my parents and brothers.
		I also enjoy the outdoors and use to do a good deal of rock climbing and hiking.
